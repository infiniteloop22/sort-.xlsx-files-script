# sort excel spreadsheets by columns (.xlsx) script

Note: I wanted to practice pandas library and learn how to implement it, so I made this script.

How to run this script:

1. Have `Python` installed
2. A text editor or IDE
3. Run this command: `git clone` to clone this repository
4. Run the script with `python ./src/script.py`
