# Sort Excel spreadsheets by columns (.xlsx) script

Note: I wanted to practice pandas library and learn how to implement it, so I made this script.

How to run this script:

1. Have `Python` installed.
2. A text editor or IDE
3. `git clone` this repository
4. run the script with `python ./src/script.py`
